📘 Student Result Processing System

🚀 Project Overview

A lightweight SQL project designed for educational institutions or learners. It demonstrates how to manage student performance data, including storing records, assessing pass/fail status, calculating GPA, and generating student rankings—while ensuring compatibility with MySQL versions below 8.0 (no window functions).


---

🧠 Purpose & Motivation

To provide a simple yet functional system for academic result management

Ideal for students learning SQL and database fundamentals

Compatible with legacy systems unable to support modern window functions



---

📋 Project Structure

Tables Included

Students — core student data

Courses — course metadata and credits

Grades — marks assigned to each student-course pair


(Fields like primary keys and foreign keys are defined clearly in project documentation.)

⚙ Setup Instructions

1. Initialize the MySQL database and create a new schema.


2. Use provided CREATE TABLE script to define the normalized tables.


3. Insert sample dataset using INSERT INTO statements.


4. Run analytical queries for GPA, pass/fail evaluation, and ranking.


5. Export results/reports as needed for further use or presentation.
